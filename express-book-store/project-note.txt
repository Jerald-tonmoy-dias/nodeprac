debugging issues related to docker

1️⃣ Shut down Docker and WSL completely
Run PowerShell as Administrator, then execute:
wsl --shutdown


This stops all WSL2 instances (which Docker uses under the hood).
2️⃣ Restart the Docker Windows NAT layer
Still in PowerShell (Admin):
net stop winnat
net start winnat
✅ This clears all ghost port bindings that were left locked by Windows.


3️⃣ Restart Docker Desktop

Now:

Quit Docker Desktop completely

Then reopen it (run as Administrator, recommended)
